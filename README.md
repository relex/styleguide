Relex Style Guides
===================

Relex style guide is based on the Google style guides and currently hold for only select languages.

It is a set of sometimes arbitrary conventions on how to write code at Relex. It is not documenting how the code currently is, but instead, how it should be. Consistent style should make it easier to handle our codebase.

Term “Style” covers a lot of ground, from more superficial such like “use camelCase for variable names” to decisions concerning program structure, such as “never use global variables” and “never use exceptions.”

We currently have style guides for [Java][java] and [Ruby][ruby]. For JavaScript, there is a linter. Document so far updated for Relex use is the Java Style Guide.

Disagreements and clarifications are welcome.
